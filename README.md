# django-blog-project

Followed the following tutorial up to deployment:

In this app users can create, update, and delete posts. There is a home page with pagination that displays all of the current posts, and users can click on a username to see of all that specific user's posts. Only the author can delete and edit their posts. There is also a signup and update email/password/profile picture form.

I made sure I understood every line of code I was implementing. In order to test my understanding I created my own endpoint /stats/, a model (using Object Relational Mapping) Csstats, and added custom html and CSS for this page.

From doing this full stack project I learned a lot about how applications work as a whole, and specifically learned a lot about http requests, databases, CRUD operations, forms, and general debugging (despite following a tutorial, there were still some bugs). Addiontaly it was nice to get some experience using a framework; Django was the first time I had used a framework, and it was fascinating to see how many features it has built in.

It was interesting to see these concepts I had read about in practice, and I think it really deepened my understanding of them.


I have included a requirements.txt file listing all of the packages needed for the project.
