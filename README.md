# django-blog-project

Followed the following tutorial up to deployment:

I made sure I understood every line of code I was implementing. In order to test my understanding I created my own endpoint /stats/, a model (using Object Relational Mapping) Csstats, and added custom html and CSS for this page.

From doing this full stack project I learned a lot about how applications work as a whole, and specifically learned a lot about http requests, databases, forms, and general debugging (despite following a tutorial, there were still some bugs).
It was interesting to see these concepts I had read about in practice, and I think it really deepened my understanding of them.

I have included a requirements.txt file listing all of the packages needed for the project.
